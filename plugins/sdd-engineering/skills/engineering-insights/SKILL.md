name: engineering-insights
description: Captures and preserves non-obvious engineering discoveries in the affected module's insights.md file. Use when — (1) discovering a non-obvious solution, failure pattern, architectural decision, or dependency quirk mid-session ("capture as you go"); or (2) wrapping up a session longer than 30 minutes where a real problem was solved or discovered. Writes append-only to the insights.md of the most directly affected module of the host repository. Does not record observations obvious from reading the code or already in the repo's instruction files.

# Engineering insights

Preserves non-obvious engineering knowledge so future agents inherit institutional project knowledge rather than re-discovering it from scratch.

## Three Invocation Modes

**Mode A — Capture as you go** (invoke immediately mid-session):
- Unexpected dependency behavior that cost time to diagnose
- Failure mode that is invisible from reading the code
- Architectural constraint whose reasoning would otherwise be lost
- Workaround for a non-obvious tool or env quirk

**The trigger is a discovery made *in this session*, not a request to explain a concept.**
Before invoking, ask: "Did something just happen — a bug diagnosed, a behavior observed, a
decision made — or is the user only asking me to describe how something works?" Only the former
qualifies.

| Signal | Invoke? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "I just figured out why the pgvector query returned zero rows — the column dimension didn't match" | Yes | Reports a concrete failure just diagnosed in this session |
| "Explain how pgvector column dimensions work and why a mismatch returns zero rows" | **No** | Pure explanation request — no bug was hit, nothing was diagnosed, there is no session-specific discovery to preserve |
| "I just figured out `X` — the migration was silently skipped because Y" | Yes | Past-tense discovery, tied to something that happened |
| "How does `X` work / what would happen if Y?" | **No** | Hypothetical or conceptual question, not a report of what occurred |

A prompt phrased as pure Q&A — even about the exact same technical topic as a real past
discovery — is not a trigger. Explaining pgvector dimensionality in the abstract is not the same
event as diagnosing why *this session's* query returned zero rows.

**Mode B — Wrap-up** (invoke at session end, or via `/engineering-insights`):
- Session was > 30 minutes AND involved a real problem, decision, or discovery
- Skip: trivial config edits, dependency bumps, typo fixes, pure refactors with no surprises

Zero entries is a valid wrap-up outcome for clean, uneventful sessions.

**Mode C — Session start** (invoke when beginning work on a module):
1. Identify which module files will be touched
2. Read the module's `insights.md`
3. Output in response: total entry count + the 3–5 entries most relevant to the current task
4. Stop — do not write anything in this mode

---

> **HARD CONSTRAINT — existing insights.md files are immutable except via the Edit tool.**
> The Write tool erases the entire file. It is permitted only to create a brand-new insights.md
> from the template when the file does not yet exist.
> Every operation on an existing file (append entry, update footer, mark stale, extend entry)
> MUST use the Edit tool with an exact `old_string` match. No exceptions.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Apply the Discovery Bar

Ask: **"Would a fresh agent reading this save ≥10 minutes of re-discovery?"**

If no → stop. See [criteria.md](criteria.md) for full filter with examples.

### Step 2 — Identify the Target Module

Determine the host repo's modules from its layout — the top-level packages/workspaces (e.g. a
frontend package, a backend package, a shared library, an e2e suite). The rule is one insights
file per module:

| Files touched | Write to |
|---|---|
| `<module>/…` | `<module>/insights.md` |
| repo root / cross-cutting | `insights.md` at the repo root |

If multiple modules are touched, write to the **most directly affected** one. Never duplicate the same insight across files.

If the target `insights.md` does not exist: use the Write tool to create it from [templates/insights.md](templates/insights.md).
If the file already exists: never use Write — proceed directly to Step 3.

### Step 3 — Read, Summarize, Check for Duplicates

Read the target `insights.md`. Then output in response:

```
Read [module]/insights.md — N entries found.
Relevant to current discovery: [list 0–3 entries, or "none"]
Duplicate of existing entry: [yes/no — if yes, extend that entry instead]
```

After summarizing:
- **Duplicate found** → use the **Edit tool** to locate the exact existing entry text (`old_string` = the full entry line) and append a dated note to it. Do not add a new list item.
- **Existing entry is now wrong (supersession)** → use the **Edit tool** twice, in place, to mark the original stale and record the correction as **two bullets**:
  1. Replace the exact original entry with its struck form — the bullet marker stays outside the strikethrough so it still renders as a list item:
     `- ~~**YYYY-MM-DD [Category]** — original text. \`file:line\`~~ (superseded YYYY-MM-DD)`
  2. Append the corrected entry as a **new bullet on the line immediately below**, in standard format with today's date.
  The footer count does **not** change on supersession: the struck entry drops out of the count and its correction takes its place (net zero). Only increment the footer when adding a genuinely new insight — never when superseding. See [format.md](format.md) § Stale Entry for the exact shape.

### Step 4 — Classify

Pick exactly one category:

| Category | When |
|---|---|
| **Pattern** | Approach that worked; reusable solution |
| **Mistake** | Failure mode, antipattern, wrong assumption |
| **Decision** | Architectural or design choice with reasoning |
| **Quirk** | Dependency gotcha, env constraint, non-obvious tool behavior |

When unsure, prefer **Mistake** — it is the most commonly skipped and most valuable category.

### Step 5 — Append via Edit tool

Follow the format in [format.md](format.md). Then use **Edit only** — never Write:

1. Read the current `insights.md` to get the exact text around the insertion point
2. Locate the last existing entry in the target section (or the section's placeholder comment `<!-- ... -->` if the section is empty)
3. Use Edit: `old_string` = that last line exactly, `new_string` = that same line + `\n` + the new entry
4. Locate the current footer line `*Last updated: … · Entries: …*`
5. Use Edit to replace it with the updated date and incremented count

Do not read the file and reconstruct it from scratch. Do not use Write. Touch only the two precise locations: the insertion point and the footer line.

## Wrap-up Checklist (Mode B)

Work through these in order. Each question targets a different category:

```
Wrap-up Progress:
- [ ] What failed or took unexpectedly long? (→ Mistake)
- [ ] What constraint exists that is invisible from the code? (→ Quirk or Decision)
- [ ] What decision was made, and why? (→ Decision)
- [ ] What dependency or tool behaved unexpectedly? (→ Quirk)
- [ ] What approach worked and should be reused? (→ Pattern)
- [ ] Discovery bar applied to each candidate?
- [ ] Duplicates checked?
- [ ] Entries appended and footer updated?
```

Aim for 0–5 entries per session.

## Maintenance (do not do during capture)

**Monthly:** Scan for stale entries (referenced file deleted, behavior fixed upstream). Mark with ~~strikethrough~~ or remove.

**Promotion:** When an insight has saved time in 3 or more sessions, consider promoting it to the module's instruction file (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`) as a permanent rule. Replace the entry with: `→ Promoted to CLAUDE.md YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Pruning:** If any single section exceeds 30 entries, signal-to-noise is degrading. Either prune aggressively or split into a domain-scoped file (e.g., `<module>/insights-db.md`) and add a pointer in the main file.
